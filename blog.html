                    <p id="content">I think I found the most interesting new restaurant of the year, and it’s in Park
                        Slope of all places. Just off the roundabout on the southwestern tip of Prospect Park is a place
                        called Syko, which is short for “Syrian” and “Korean.” This is not a Syrian-Korean fusion
                        restaurant, mind you, but more like a Syrian-Korean KFC–Taco Bell with each discrete concept
                        represented on its own, down to the customer-facing kitchen counter with mise en place split
                        through the middle according to cuisine. </p>

                    <h3 id="author">By: Host Dean Martin</h3>
                    <p id="content">When Mangieri was younger, he met his friends at Italian clubs in northern New
                        Jersey. “The espresso was great, but nothing else,” he says. “It was more of a hangout place for
                        guys to play in the back room, smoke cigarettes and berate each other.” But somewhere between
                        those smoky social clubs and numerous trips to Italy, Mangieri worked on his caffeine tolerance
                        and also became a coffee authority. “I sometimes take eight shots a day,” he says. “If you drink
                        a properly brewed espresso.</p>

                    <h3 id="author">By: Owner Gary Dominguez</h3>
                    <p id="content">Last week, when I saw that the omakase restaurant Icca had posted about its new
                        “Japanese/Italian” menu on Instagram, I decided to make my way over to Tribeca for some fancy
                        fusion. Although the full sushi menu is served in a different room, I was able to benefit from a
                        zen atmosphere, minimalist decor, and careful service. The high back-bar seats are really
                        comfortable, which is important when you’re splitting two pastas and two risottos with a friend.

                        doing the unthinkable: staying in on their nights off.</h1>

                    <p id="content">Anyone who eats out with any kind of frequency will tell you the same thing:
                        Something feels off. There is still much to be happy about — like the fact that so many
                        restaurants are still open at all — but prices are up, portion sizes are down, and ongoing labor
                        woes continue to take a toll on service quality. The situation is difficult, and even the people
                        who work in restaurants (typically enthusiastic customers and big tippers) are questioning the
                        value proposition of a night out.</p>
